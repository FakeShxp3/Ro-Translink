                <p class="description-description">
                    P2P Studios was founded by Thyssen and Noodle with two goals in mind: Do what others can't, and have fun.<br><br> So far, we've been highly successful - innovating further than what people had thought was "impossible", and in record timeframes. We strive to make our experiences and products as realistic, stable, and immersive as possible.

                <p class="description-description">
                    P2P Studios was founded by two teenagers, who are still leading the company forwards as acting owners. Noodle leads rail operations, and Thyssen leads bus operations - both of them oversee development and script P2P's highly-regarded line of vehicle chassis systems. We have a strong executive team to assist or lead departments, as well as a developer & supervisor team. Visit our <a href="team.html">Team Members</a> page to learn more.

                <p class="description-description">
                    P2P Studios has a unique array of products and games. We have a recreation of TransLink's INIT ("TMAC") system, a revolutionary bus chassis, an incredibly complex route management system, lag-free & advanced AI Passengers, and more. P2P has game built from scratch, directly under P2P Studios - Ro-Translink, a recreation of Vancouver's transit system. Other games, such as BRUG's MBTA, Suburban's Halifax, and our BRT acquisition will utilize P2P Products. Visit our <a href="projects.html">Projects Page</a> to learn more.
