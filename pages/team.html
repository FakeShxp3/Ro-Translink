                    Noodle, also known as Noodle_Developer on Roblox, founded P2P in March, where he began work on Gen1. Later that year in August, Noodle collaborated with Thyssen to create Gen2. After they had finished, P2P was revamped to P2P Studios, and Noodle and Thyssen remain as the two Founders of P2P Studios, continuing to lead and develop to this day. Noodle is one of two main scripters for P2P Studios.

                    Thyssen started out in the transit community when he was 12, and quickly gained a bad reputation for stealing TranslinkGuy's destination setter GUI. Determined to learn from his mistakes, he began working on NextWave's revamped chassis. After a successful launch, he began work on a custom chassis named 'OCv3', however he later dropped the project after he began work on P2P's Gen2 with Noodle in August of 2024.
