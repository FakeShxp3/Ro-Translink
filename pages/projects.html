                    Project Polaris was P2P's first ever project. Anything bus-chassis related falls directly under Polaris - e.g Gen2.1. We have a few buses that currently operate on Gen2.1, the latest update to our chassis: Xcelsior, Orion V, Enviro500, D(E)60LFR, and our D40LF. Project Polaris stands out as one of the only bus chassis systems in North America featuring an interactive system, realistic engine operations, smooth suspension, and more. Gen2.1 is also incredibly stable and optimized.

                    Project Odyssey is the codename for P2P's train chassis. While development is on the backburner until Ro-Translink is fully released with buses, development will pick up when we have enough skytrain stations. Project Odyssey will be embedded fully into Ro-Translink, making it a multi-operational game. We will have the following trains, running on a hybrd automatic/manual system:
