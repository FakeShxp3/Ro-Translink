                    Project Polaris was P2P's first ever project. Anything bus-chassis related falls directly under Polaris - e.g Gen2.1. We have a few buses that currently operate on Gen2.1, the latest update to our chassis: Xcelsior, Orion V, Enviro500, D(E)60LFR, and our D40LF. Project Polaris stands out as one of the only bus chassis systems in North America featuring an interactive system, realistic engine operations, smooth suspension, and more. Gen2.1 is also incredibly stable and optimized.
